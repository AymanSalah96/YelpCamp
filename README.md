# YelpCamp

This project was completed as a part of [the web developer bootcamp course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

Yelp Camp is a fun application that allows you to view campgrounds with a short description. Once you logged in or signed up you can
begin to create your own campgrounds that includes a title, price, image url and a short description. You will also be able to leave a comment or edit a campground of yours.
